(also note the info provided info in this thread regarding the mobile app and SPA on the web). 

There are many dynamic page routes not listed that pull resource info from a spreadsheet API managed by TTF. 

If theres anything else you need, particularly around information stored in the database, please let me know and I would be happy to export in JSON or CSV format.

ZH: Yes please export JSON and CSV formats

For the CMS, TTF doesn't use one. It is a custom built, single page web app meant to mimic the functionality of the mobile app. 

If they want a list of pages (templates) I would be happy to send those over. 

We also do not use a CRM. 

The app backend is Firebase, a NoSQL database in which we store user info, contact queries, new ministry submissions etc. 

If they would like me to export the existing user data, I am happy to do that as well.

ZH: Yes, export existing user data.
